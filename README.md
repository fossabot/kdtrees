**Python implementation of a K-D Tree as a pseudo-balanced Tree**

## Overview

K-Dimensional Tree is a space-partitioning data structure, efficiently organizing points in k-dimensional space.

This K-D Tree implementation allows for construction, modification and searching of a K-D Tree. It also maintains the tree in a pseudo-balanced manner through a secondary invariant where every node is the median Â± dimensionality of subsidiary nodes along a specific axis.
